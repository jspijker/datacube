RIVM datacube
=========

The RIVM datacube is a repository of spatial grid based data, aimed at data-science projects involving spatial data. It is suitable for combining field measurements with spatial data (e.g. soiltypes, groundwaterlevels, landuse, emission data etc.). All the spatial data in the datacube is georeferenced to the same extent, so maps can be stacked easily. This R package is a generic interface to the data, enabling quik development of (machine learning) models 

Please note: this is work in progress, do not expect a functional
package yet.

Installation in R , using the devtools package:
`devtools::install_git("https://gitl01-int-p.rivm.nl/spijkerj/datacube.git")`
